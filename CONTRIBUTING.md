# Contributing to "Up To Infinity Incremental"

We are thrilled that you are interested in contributing to our project! This document will guide you through the necessary steps to contribute your valuable work to "Up To Infinity Incremental," We want to make this process simple and transparent, so here is a step-by-step guide.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

- **Familiarize yourself with Astro:** If you haven't already, make sure to understand how Astro works. You can find plenty of useful information in the official [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/).

- **Why we use Git?**  
  Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your project efficiently. It is essential for contributing to this project.

- **Installing Git:**  
  If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from the official website: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.


- **Set up your development environment:** We recommend using `pnpm` as the package manager for its efficiency and speed. If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it by running:
  ```
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

## How to Contribute ðŸ› 

### 1. Set up your environment

- **Fork the repository:** Create a fork of the project to your GitHub account. To do this, click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

- **Add the original repository as a remote:** To keep your fork up to date with changes from the original repository, add the original repo as an upstream remote:
  ```
  git remote add upstream <URL of the original repository>
  ```

## Best Practices ðŸŒŸ

- Check open issues before opening a PR. If you think you can fix one and no other PR is open for it, reference the issue number in your commit message using `#issue-number` so it links automatically. It's also helpful to leave a comment to indicate which PR is addressing the issue.

- Review open PRs to avoid duplicating work. You can also help by contributing to existing PRs with changes, comments, or reviews.

- Keep your commits clean and descriptive.

- Follow the project's coding conventions.

- Frequently update your branch to stay current with the main branch.

- Participate in PR discussions if there are comments or suggestions.
